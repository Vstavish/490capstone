# Data.gov Salary Data Instructional User Guide
## Purpose of project
The purpose of this instructional user guide is to aid in the understanding and use of publicly available salary data from Data.gov. This user guide provides those who wish to access information from Data.gov with documentation on how to navigate and properly use the public data on the website. By making an accessible user guide to this data, we hope those interested in researching salary data, such as academics, economists, journalists, employees and/or employers as well as regular consumers, can understand what salaries look like in their industry or their geographic areas and empower them to use salary data to do their own analyses and draw their own conclusions.

## Background
Data.gov is The United States Government's open data site and was originally made public in 2009 with the goal to publicize data about the nation and improve transparency about the nation and its government, according to the site’s ‘About’ page. Data.gov is managed and hosted by the U.S. General Services Administration and is developed publicly on GitHub.
